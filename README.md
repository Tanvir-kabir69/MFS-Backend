## üìå Minimul Project Overview

- ‚úÖ JWT-based login system(role based) with : `SUPER ADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `AGENT`, `USER`
- ‚úÖ Secure password hashing (using bcrypt)
- ‚úÖ Each user and agent must have a wallet automatically created at registration (e.g., initial balance: ‡ß≥50 or set manually via env variables)
- ‚úÖ Users are able to:
    - Add money (top-up)
    - Withdraw money
    - Send money to another user
    - View transaction history
- ‚úÖ Agents are able to:
    - Add money to any user's wallet (cash-in)

    - View their commission history.
- ‚úÖ Admins are able to:
    - Perform User, Agent and Admin Operations
    - View all users, agents and transactions. But not wallet(Its Users Personal Information)
    - Block/unblock user (By blocking user Wallet is blocked aytomatically)
    - Approve/suspend agents
- ‚úÖ Super Admin is able to:
    - Perform Admin and Agent Operations

- ‚úÖ All transactions are **stored and trackable**
- ‚úÖ Role-based route protection is implemented

## üß† Questions and Answering Guides

*Consider these questions and answers carefully before testing this system. They will make you understand system architecture and logic.*

### üè¶ Wallet Creation & Management

- How will wallets be created?
    - Automatically during registration.
- What happens during registration?
    - users get an wallet automatically.
    - users will have the initial balance that set `SUPER ADMIN`
- Can users inactivate wallets?
    - user can not directly inactivate/activate his wallet. But by by being inactivate/active they can make their wallet inactivate/active.
- What happens when a wallet is blocked?
    - wallet can not be blocked automatically. Admin or Super Admin Blocks/Unblocks an User. If the user is blocked, its wallet is supposed to be blocked. So, the user can not perform any transaction throw their wallet.

---

### üîÅ Transaction Management

- What fields are essential?
    - receiverEmail, amount, transaction_type is required
- How will be handled transaction status?
    - transaction will either successful or cancelled.
- What about atomic operations?
    - Transaction,  Charges and Commissions are handeled automatically during a transaction.

---

### üë• Role Representation

- How will be distinguished between users, agents, and admins?
    - Single User model with a role field.
    - No Separate models for all roles with shared authentication.
- What unique fields does each need?
    - Agents: commission rate, approval status maintained throw request and request approoval by higher authority.
    - Admins: permission levels are handeled by internal middlewares and functionality. 
- How will agent approval work?
    - Agent will place an agent role request, if the request is accepted by admin or super admin, then they will play agent role.
- How will Admin approval work?
    - Admin will place an Admin role request, if the request is accepted by super admin, then they will play Admin role.

---

### ü´Ü Validations & Business Rules

- What validations will be enforced?
    - e.g., **insufficient balance**, **non-existent receiver**, **negative amounts**
- Can a user **send/withdraw** from a blocked wallet?
    - If an user is blocked, his wallet is also blocked, so, not possible.
- Can agents perform cash-in/out for blocked user wallets? What should happen if attempted?
    - No, agent can not. If they try, they will not success and get error.
- Will there be **minimum balance** requirements?
    - No, their is no minimum balance requirements. Your money is your asset. As long as you have money. You can use them.

---

### **üìú Access & Visibility**

- How will users/agents access their **wallet and transaction history**?
    - Throw their transaction history api. transaction_type query supported.
- Can a user view **other users‚Äô wallets or history**? (Why/Why not?)
    - None but the user can see their wallet amount.
    - Wallet is users Personal and it should be kept secret.
- What can **admins** see?
    - All users/agents
    - All transactions

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è How to get stared?

The proper way to use this service is to become an `USER` of this system. So, let's be an `USER` 
##


### 1\. Register as an user :

**POST** `api/v1/user/register`

#### Request:

```json
<!-- These are required fields -->
{
    "name" : "Tanvir",
    "email" : "example@gmail.com",
    "password" :"Ex@12345678",
    "phone": "01500000000"
}
```
* provide a valid user `name`
* `email` must be `unique`
* password should be `secured`
* `phone` number must be valid `Bangladeshi` number
* default `role` of an user is automatically `USER` handeled by database.
* `USER` can place request for `AGENT` and `ADMIN`, which is approoved by appropriate authority but no specific collection is created for `AGENT` and `ADMIN` in database.
* an `WALLET` is created automatically in the database after creating an user successfully, which `INITIAL BALANCE` is handeled by assign a value in the `ENVIRONMENT`

### ‚úÖAfter successful register, you can now :
* See your `Profile`. **GET:** `api/v1/user/me`
* `Update` your profile `name`, `phone`, `address`. **PATCH:** `api/v1/user/:userId`
### ‚ö†Ô∏èBut before that, you must log in to your account.


### 2. Log in as an user :

**POST** `api/v1/auth/login`

#### Request:

```json
<!-- These are required fields -->
{
    "email" : "example@gmail.com",
    "password" :"Ex@12345678"
}
```
* provide your valid `email` and `password` to log in successfully.

### 3. Alternative to create user and login(Google Login)
If you just want to avoid create an account and log in, you can just continue with `Google`

* **GET** `api/v1/auth/google`
* Login from google `oauth` page with your `google account`
* You will automatically have an `user profile` and `Wallet` 

### ‚úÖAfter successful login, you can now :
* `CASH IN` into your `WALLET` from an `AGENT` or higher authority like `ADMIN` or `SUPER ADMIN`. See details in `Transaction` section.
* `CASH OUT` from your `WALLET` from an `AGENT` or higher authority like `ADMIN` or `SUPER ADMIN` but `CHARGE` applicable. See details in `Transaction` section.
* `SENT MONEY` from your wallet to other `USER`, `AGENT` or higher authority like `ADMIN`, `SUPER ADMIN` but `CHARGE` applicable. See details in `Transaction` section.
* See your ``Profile. **GET:** `api/v1/user/me`
* See your wallet `balance`. **GET:** `api/v1/wallet/my-balance`
* Update your profile `name`, `phone`, `address`. **PATCH:** `api/v1/user/:userId`
* Can request for higher authority like `AGENT` or `ADMIN`. See details in `Role Management` section.
* Can get new access token. **POST:** `api/v1/auth/access-token`
* Can `Change Password`. **POST:** `api/v1/auth/change-password`. Details in `Postman`
* Or can **`Log Out`**. **POST:** `api/v1/auth/logout`
